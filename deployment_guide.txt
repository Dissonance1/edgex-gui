EdgeX-GUI arm64 Deployment Guide
===============================

1. WHAT WAS DONE
----------------
- Built the EdgeX-GUI application for arm64 architecture.
- Resolved dependency issues: Fixed the "t64" library mismatch by building natively on the Ubuntu 22.04 device.
- Theme & Logo Fix: Bundled the theme (ModernTheme.qss) and the logo (honeycomblogo.png) into the binary using Qt Resource System (:/.qrc). This ensures the UI looks correct regardless of where the app is started.
- Desktop Integration: Created a desktop shortcut with the Honeycomb icon on the Aetina device.

2. HOW TO INSTALL THE .DEB FILE
------------------------------
If you have the .deb file (edgex-gui-1.0.0-Linux.deb), run the following command on the ARM device:

   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install ./edgex-gui-1.0.0-Linux.deb

Using 'apt' instead of 'dpkg -i' is recommended because 'apt' will automatically download any missing Qt6 dependencies from the internet.

3. HOW TO RUN THE APPLICATION
-----------------------------
A. From the Desktop:
   Double-click the "EdgeX GUI" icon on your desktop.

B. From the Terminal:
   Run the command:
   edgex-qt-ui

C. Run remotely via SSH:
   If you want to launch the app on the device's screen while connected via SSH, run:
   DISPLAY=:0 edgex-qt-ui

4. BUILD FROM SOURCE (ON THE DEVICE)
-----------------------------------
If you need to rebuild the app on the device itself:
   cd ~/edgex-gui-build
   mkdir -p build && cd build
   cmake ..
   make -j4
   sudo make install

5. FILE PATHS
-------------
- Binary: /usr/bin/edgex-qt-ui
- Desktop Icon: ~/Desktop/edgex-gui.desktop
- Icon Image: /usr/share/pixmaps/edgex-gui.png
